# rainbow-blustery-day

This utilizes the UV map as of 21w10a, and will likely not be reliable for future versions of the game. This is mainly a proof of concept.

This wasn't meant to be anything pretty, so you may see a bit (a lot) of repeated code in the vertex shaders. I tried to add anything that was a cutout and green to the rainbow.
I also experimented with adding some waviness/wind to some objects.

Have fun!
